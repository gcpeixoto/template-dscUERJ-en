Happiness is difficult to be defined. However, it can be inferred by experience that the mankind seeks for a welfare which is ruled by this word. Since long time ago, many people living on Earth have been brooding over an ideal way to have good days. In this thesis, some features that lead to happiness are investigated with basis on the experience of Logophorus of Klektos while he had wandered on the edge between the pleasurable and the squalid lifestyle.
